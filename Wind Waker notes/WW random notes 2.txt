This is for the USA version. But maybe you can use it for the Japanese version if you don't use the "sea" and "cave 10" folders. Unsure. So anyways, I restore the Floormasters in FF1 and add some candles in FF1 and FF2. I add back the Octorocks in the Tower of the Gods as well as a switch that triggers a unused red rupee pot. In the Wind Temple, I add back that iron boots switch that triggers the joy pendant chest as well as unused makar plants from cave 08. In Outset, I add 3 pots near Orca's house as well as the unused Weak boarded up wall up the hill. I changed DRC so some rooms are like the E3 version when it comes to the actors. In cave 03 or the underground forest area, I added the unused Spike Tentacle Blockage from layer 7 to the default layer. In Orca's house upstairs, I put some actors from layer 7 I think to the default layer so they load. Also included 2 pots near the window but I had to move them. In Puppet Ganon's boss room, I restored some unused platforms and the plants. The plants are those shooting things Link can jump in. In the unused K_test 2, I put of the layer 7 unused actors to the default layer. In the sailing minigame, the npc is loaded. In the unused ktest e, I restore the 2 seagulls actors.
