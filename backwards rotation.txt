can it be possible to mod Link's backwards rotation to make a animation happen before his rotation? Like a backwards animation that was shown in prerelease? Unfortunately, it doesn't exist in the game anymore. I've checked. And adding a animation before his rotation is probably hard to do though. Because "I think Link does his stop animations" before the rotation. So maybe a custom made emote could be made for that in the meantime?
