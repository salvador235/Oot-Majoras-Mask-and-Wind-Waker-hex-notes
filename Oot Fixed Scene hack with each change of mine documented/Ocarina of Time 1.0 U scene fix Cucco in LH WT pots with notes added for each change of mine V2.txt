Dodongo's Cavern with loaded Hookshot Targets. (continued) And replaced the gold skulltula token object 15C with 12B/2B so that 1 grass clump loads in room 12. The 15C object is not needed here as it only makes Gold Skulltula Token's shinier. I couldn't add an object in this room unfortunately as there was not enough space.

0x223C0CB,3F

Death Mountain (Fanmade) Was going to enable or load the Giant Boulder with object C2 but it looked weird in CS 01 or Stage 3 so I just added the object. But you could enable the boulder with this 0x223C973,C2 if you like.
0x223C973,C2

Death Mountain (Fanmade but I feel like the Giant Boulder should be replaced here as it just doesn't fit) For CS 01 or Stage 3, I replaced the Boulder actor and made the coords the same as the heart piece one in the normal areas. Then I made it a purple rupee. You could maybe do 0x223C9EE,1E06 if you wanted so its the same variable as the regular area's heart piece though. But I didn't and made it a different flag. I rather go with the 1E06 though now that I think of it.

Death Mountain Crater For Adult Link's area, I Raised a Fire Bubble or actor 10 so it can trigger when Link walks over a wooden plank in Stage 1 for room 2. It could only trigger underneath it in the final.

Fire Temple Navi Information spot fix in Fire Temple room 14. Y coord was moved lower I think so it can be triggered. And then the unknown 16 or 0x236C05F,16 makes it so after you hit the top part of the megaton statue or set switch flag 15, the navi information spot actor will disappear.

(Fanmade sort of) Jabu-Jabu's Belly This is transition actor 21's variable fix in CS 00 so it can be opened with 3F. This door could not be opened here in the final as there is no switch that can open BF here which is switch flag 3F. This door is in room 6 or the preboss room.

Ganon's Tower (Outside) Link's spawnpoint fix for CS 00 so his coords are the same as the regular area. This fix fixes it so Link can enter the area from the Market Adult area without being put back as his spawnpoint before this fix was behind the collision trigger for entering the Market Adult area. I don't think you can test this ingame with the map select as the opt option doesn't work unfortunately.

(Fanmade) Cutscene Map Link is present in all areas of the CS Map except Stage 3 or CS 02, Stage 8 or CS 07, and Stage 9 or CS 08. I did this as you can see him in those 2 unless you move him. You can't see him actually in the other stages with him present I think since it doesn't render that far away. Unless you use a cheat code though.

Spirit Temple Navi Targettable spot fix on the Goddess Statue's head in room 6
0x2B251BF,7E

(Fanmade) Spirit Temple Added a Water Temple Metal Gate actor in front of the flame circle and moved the flame circle a bit in room 23. I did this to patch the hookshot boss key chest glitch in this room where if you get damaged and hookshot the chest, you can open it. Also, adding the Water Temple object or 59 makes the Fake Doors a Water Temple door.

(Fanmade) Jabu Jabu's Belly (Boss) Lowered the y coord of the door to the ground as Link could not open it to get back inside Jabu Jabu's Belly since the door was a brown door. And not a Jabu Jabu skin door which are usually in the air or positioned differently. This door is behind a collision wall so you can't really open it by normal means

(Fanmade) Shadow Temple (Boss) Collision Changed for the Exit to the Shadow Temple from the boss room as the area will crash if it gets triggered. I could not figure out how to fix that crash so this will do. Unfortunately, if this collision was changed to prevent the crash, you can't get back inside room 2. You will be stuck in room 1 as you can't open the boss door from the other side. So you either have to warp out or save and quit.

(Fanmade) Ganon's Castle In room 1, objects reordered or made the same so some actors don't disappear when going from room 1 to 2. And replaced a out of bounds actor B7 or the Reflectable Light Beam that wouldn't load with a Sliding Spike Trap or actor 80 from MQ I think.

Ganon's Castle Room 4's Wallmaster can be triggered with the rusted dungeon switch or actor 5 as I changed his switch flag. Maybe the game made the Timed Rooms with a Wallmaster because they needed a enemy so there can be a Timer as if there is no enemy, the Timer can get set as you go into the room I believe.

The 79 is a coord fix for the bombable wall so its less close to the door. If the coord was not fixed, Link can open the door to go through the bombable wall in room 1 to room 2.

Royal Family's Tomb CS 00 or Stage 1 and CS 01 or Stage 2's Royal Family Tomb Door object 18F and Bombable wall object 18A loaded by replacing 2 useless objects with it for room 3. By the way, you need all the non (Fanmade) Royal Family's Tomb stuff as the transitions that are used in this area are variable 3F so all objects need to be the same for all rooms. The 7F is a Y coord fix so its lower for the Play Ocarina Here Spot 12E actor. This makes it so Link can check the actor as in those unused CS setups in the final, Link could not do that.

(Fanmade) Talon's House Added Young Malon object and actor by shifting the scene in room 3 which is the area Ingo sleeps when you are an Adult. Young Malon only appears here as a child at night after you give the chicken to wake Talon up in Hyrule Castle. She has unused coding to do so. Atm, with these hex address changes, you can only see Young Malon here at night through the Map Select or by cheating since the door can't be opened at night to go into Talon's House.
