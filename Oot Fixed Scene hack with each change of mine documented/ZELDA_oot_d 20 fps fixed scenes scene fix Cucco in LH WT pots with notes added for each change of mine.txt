(Fanmade) Dodongo's Cavern Don't change this actor behind the pushblock. It was originally a heart but for some reason, I changed it to a blue rupee in room 10
0x20AC13F,01

Dodongo's Cavern with loaded Hookshot Targets. (continued) And replaced the gold skulltula token object 15C with 12B/2B so that 1 grass clump loads in room 12. The 15C object is not needed here as it only makes Gold Skulltula Token's shinier. I couldn't add an object in this room unfortunately as there was not enough space.

Jabu-Jabu's Belly Made Waterbox 3 really long and big so in CS 00, the Octorocks in room 13 can load but unfortunately, they are underneath the ground as Waterbox 3 is in room 4 and its lower for that room. I could not figure out if I could of added a 9th waterbox to this scene.

Jabu-Jabu's Belly This is a door coord and loading fix for transition actor 13 in CS 00. The 0D makes it so the previous room is room 14. This is in room 4.
0x20EE84A,0D
0x20EE84E,FDBB

0x20EE8C8,0F
0x20EE8D2,F7B9

(Fanmade sort of) Jabu-Jabu's Belly This is transition actor 21's variable fix in CS 00 so it can be opened with 3F. This door could not be opened here in the final as there is no switch that can open BF here which is switch flag 3F. This door is in room 6 or the preboss room.
0x20EE8D7,3F

Jabu-Jabu's Belly This is a coord fix for the 2 Bari enemies so they are inbounds in room 8 for CS 00
0x211F1EE,EE3A
0x211F1FE,EE3A

(Fanmade) Jabu-Jabu's Belly These are chest flag fixes for CS 00 so the chest flags don't interfere with the normal area or stage 0 and vice versa. In the final, if you open all chests in the regular area, all of these chests in the CS area will be opened. This fixes that.

Fire Temple Navi Information spot fix in Fire Temple room 14. Y coord was moved lower I think so it can be triggered. And then the unknown 16 or 0x236C05F,16 makes it so after you hit the top part of the megaton statue or set switch flag 15, the navi information spot actor will disappear.

(Fanmade) Spirit Temple Added a Water Temple Metal Gate actor in front of the flame circle and moved the flame circle a bit in room 23. I did this to patch the hookshot boss key chest glitch in this room where if you get damaged and hookshot the chest, you can open it. Also, adding the Water Temple object or 59 makes the Fake Doors a Water Temple door.

Ganon's Castle Room 4's Wallmaster can be triggered with the rusted dungeon switch or actor 5 as I changed his switch flag. Maybe the game made the Timed Rooms with a Wallmaster because they needed a enemy so there can be a Timer as if there is no enemy, the Timer can get set as you go into the room I believe.

Lost Woods Octorock loaded in room 4 for Young Link. The 0x2962C95,07E1 makes it so the waterbox loads in all rooms as the Octorock would not load through the transitions if it wasn't. The 0C extends the object list for all rooms for Young Link so I could add the Octorock for him.

Lost Woods (Fanmade) In CS 00, changed the bean plant spot's switch flag from 04 to 1E. Not sure why I bothered though.

Lost Woods Octorock loaded in room 4 for Adult Link. I replaced the 1st object with Octorock or 0007 in the list for all rooms for this one as that object wasn't being used. The 0x2962C95,07E1 makes it so the waterbox loads in all rooms as the Octorock would not load through the transitions if it wasn't.

Also, y coord fixes for bringing up the circle of rocks and the underground Warp Pad so they are both at a higher position. Also, you may not need these 2, 0x29B2739,08 and 0x29B275F,68 but I just wanted to add back in the Ocarina pedestal object just incase.

(Fanmade) Gerudo's Fortress In CS 02 or Stage 5, I changed the variable of the Gerudo Training Area Gate from FF to 03 so it can open when set in the regular areas or Stage 0, Stage 1, and Stage 2 for room 1.
0x29CF95F,03

Gerudo's Fortress For unloaded Signposts loaded for Child Link for room 2. (Had to fix this as the object lists need to be the same for both rooms.)
0x29E1066,012F

Gerudo's Fortress (Fanmade sort of) Changed the coords of Adult Link's Signpost for Stage 1 and Stage 2 for the Archery Minigame so that its moved farther back as in CS 00, he knocks it over. He doesn't do it here but I had to make them the same coord. This is for Room 2

0x29E1764,0162

(Fanmade) Don't add this. Gerudo's Fortress Changed the horseback archery target actors to collectibles or actor 15 for room 2. I only did this as those horseback archery targets did nothing for Stage 4 or CS 01 for some odd reason in the ending credits area

(Fanmade) Death Mountain. Link appears in CS 5 or Stage 6. Its the ending credits CS with the Sages. I didn't do this change I think in my regular versions of my hacks. May have did it here for testing or fun.
0x2A36DEE,0D

Death Mountain (Fanmade) (Owl's switch flag is 3F so she can't get set by a permanent flag. (Only did this incase I made a switch dungeons hack for this area and he got set. As if he's set, he won't appear again.)
0x2A4E0CB,3F

Death Mountain (Not really Fanmade but I didn't like it.) Was going to enable or load the Giant Boulder with object C2 but it looked weird in CS 01 or Stage 3 so I just added the object. But you could enable the boulder with this 0x2A4E9F3,C2 if you like.
0x2A4E9F3,C2

Death Mountain (Fanmade but I feel like the Giant Boulder should be replaced here as it just doesn't fit) For CS 01 or Stage 3, I replaced the Boulder actor and made the coords the same as the heart piece one in the normal areas. Then I made it a purple rupee. You could maybe do 0x2A4EA6E,1E06 if you wanted so its the same variable as the regular area's heart piece though. But I didn't and made it a different flag. I rather go with the 1E06 though now that I think of it.

0x2A4EC52,017A

Death Mountain Crater For Adult Link's area, I Raised a Fire Bubble or actor 10 so it can trigger when Link walks over a wooden plank in Stage 1 for room 2. It could only trigger underneath it in the final.

0x2AA127E,018A

(Fanmade) Don't use this. Goron City's 2 torches that don't load in room 2 of CS 00 were replaced with invisible collectables. I did this as I didn't have a extra object space in this CS for them to load. Idk why I did it though.

(Fanmade) Item Testing Room Door near room 3 room loading changed so when you open it to load room 3, you can see the flying floor tiles. (When you load room 3 from room 2, you may not be able to see the tiles as they get destroyed when they hit the walls unless your quick enough to get to that golden area of room 3.)

Item Testing Room Grass Clump loads in room 2. (Had to replace the useless object 81 or Large noisy stone object with 12B or Grass Clump for all rooms and for the Flying tiles, I replaced object 85 or Metal Spike Trap object with 5F or the Flying tiles in room 3.) I may have added 81 and 85 objects in 2 rooms compared to my MQ Fixed Scene hack. They may not be needed as they don't load anything.

Dark Link Testing Area or Sutaru room. Load all 5 actors in this room. I replaced a useless object 98 or Redead and Gibdo object with the Stalfos object or 32. The final Debug versions of the game only loads 1 actor or Dark Link. And I had to change the Bubble's variable from 5FB to FFFF so the area doesn't crash. FFFF is the Blue Bubble. Unsure why the game crashes with the original 5FB though but it could be path related. You can also maybe change it to 0x2B4C06E,04FC to make it a small Green Bubble but I never tested it.

Ganon's Tower (Outside) Link's spawnpoint fix for CS 00 so his coords are the same as the regular area. This fix fixes it so Link can enter the area from the Market Adult area without being put back as his spawnpoint before this fix was behind the collision trigger for entering the Market Adult area. I don't think you can test this ingame with the map select as the opt option doesn't work unfortunately.

(Fanmade) Cutscene Map Link is present in all areas of the CS Map except Stage 3 or CS 02, Stage 8 or CS 07, and Stage 9 or CS 08. I did this as you can see him in those 2 unless you move him. You can't see him actually in the other stages with him present I think since it doesn't render that far away. Unless you use a cheat code though.

0x2E95037,03

(Fanmade) Jabu Jabu's Belly (Boss) Lowered the y coord of the door to the ground as Link could not open it to get back inside Jabu Jabu's Belly since the door was a brown door. And not a Jabu Jabu skin door which are usually in the air or positioned differently. This door is behind a collision wall so you can't really open it by normal means

(Fanmade) Shadow Temple (Boss) Collision Changed for the Exit to the Shadow Temple from the boss room as the area will crash if it gets triggered. I could not figure out how to fix that crash so this will do. Unfortunately, if this collision was changed to prevent the crash, you can't get back inside room 2. You will be stuck in room 1 as you can't open the boss door from the other side. So you either have to warp out or save and quit.

The original or variable 17F doors would not appear. And Rotated Boss door so Link can open it to leave. I believe you don't have to do 0x319EBBF,57 though in CS 02 or Stage 3 as that changes the Boss door's switch flag from 154 to 157. I just changed it to 157 as I wanted to use another switch flag.

Beta Castle Courtyard or Hyrule Garden Game 2. Inaccurate Fix so the scene loads. This 1st fix from Zelootma hack isn't the best as the water texture doesn't load but this is what I did for my fixed scene hack so far. So I'm going to put a better fix for it below.

Correct Fix so the scene loads with the water texture. 1st address is just to make sure its exactly 4BC8. As the Zelootma hack changed that from 4BC8 to 2708 but this isn't Zelootma or MQ Debug so you probably won't have that problem.

Royal Family's Tomb CS 00 or Stage 1 and CS 01 or Stage 2's Royal Family Tomb Door object 18F and Bombable wall object 18A loaded by replacing 2 useless objects with it for room 3. By the way, you need all the non (Fanmade) Royal Family's Tomb stuff as the transitions that are used in this area are variable 3F so all objects need to be the same for all rooms. The 7F is a Y coord fix so its lower for the Play Ocarina Here Spot 12E actor. This makes it so Link can check the actor as in those unused CS setups in the final, Link could not do that.
