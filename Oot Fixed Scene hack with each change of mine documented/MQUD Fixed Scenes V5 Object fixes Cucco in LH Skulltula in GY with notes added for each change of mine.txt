Dodongo's Cavern Armos object swapped with Grass clump object so the 2 Grass clump actors load in those 2 rooms. (I could of maybe added a object since there was space for a 16th object but I didn't know at the time. And those 15 object list rooms don't use a Armos actor in final MQ.)

Jabu-Jabu's Belly Made Waterbox 3 really long and big so in CS 00, the Octorocks in room 13 can load but unfortunately, they are underneath the ground as Waterbox 3 is in room 4 and its lower for that room. I could not figure out if I could of added a 9th waterbox to this scene.

Water Temple Locked Door switch flag fix so it uses switch flag 2 instead of 3. 3 is used in room 7 so the door gets unlocked there in the final without opening it.

Also, y coord fixes for bringing up the circle of rocks and the underground Warp Pad so they are both at a higher position.

Gerudo's Fortress (Fanmade sort of) Changed the coords of Adult Link's Signpost for Stage 1 and Stage 2 for the Archery Minigame so that its moved farther back as in CS 00, he knocks it over. He doesn't do it here but I had to make them the same coord. This is for Room 2

(Fanmade) Don't add this. Gerudo's Fortress Changed the horseback archery target actors to collectibles or actor 15 for room 2. I only did this as those horseback archery targets did nothing for Stage 4 or CS 01 for some odd reason in the ending credits area

0x2A5A0CB,3F

Death Mountain (Not really Fanmade but I didn't like it.) Was going to enable or load the Giant Boulder with object C2 but it looked weird in CS 01 or Stage 3 so I just added the object. But you could enable the boulder with this 0x2A5A9F3,C2 if you like.
0x2A5A9F3,C2

Death Mountain (Fanmade but I feel like the Giant Boulder should be replaced here as it just doesn't fit) For CS 01 or Stage 3, I replaced the Boulder actor and made the coords the same as the heart piece one in the normal areas. Then I made it a purple rupee. You could maybe do 0x2A5AA6E,1E06 if you wanted so its the same variable as the regular area's heart piece though. But I didn't and made it a different flag. I rather go with the 1E06 though now that I think of it.

0x2A5AC52,017A

Death Mountain Crater For Adult Link's area, I Raised a Fire Bubble or actor 10 so it can trigger when Link walks over a wooden plank in Stage 1 for room 2. It could only trigger underneath it in the final.

(Fanmade) Don't use this. Goron City's 2 torches that don't load in room 2 of CS 00 were replaced with invisible collectables. I did this as I didn't have a extra object space in this CS for them to load. Idk why I did it though.

0x2AC67DF,25

(Fanmade) Item Testing Room Door near room 3 room loading changed so when you open it to load room 3, you can see the flying floor tiles. (When you load room 3 from room 2, you may not be able to see the tiles as they get destroyed when they hit the walls unless your quick enough to get to that golden area of room 3.)
0x2AF60A8,01

Item Testing Room Transitions fixed for crawlspace area so it loads.
0x2AF60BA,00
0x2AF60C8,03

Item Testing Room Grass Clump loads in room 2. (Had to replace the useless object 81 or Large noisy stone object with 12B or Grass Clump for all rooms and for the Flying tiles, I replaced object 85 or Metal Spike Trap object with 5F or the Flying tiles.)

Dark Link Testing Area or Sutaru room. Load all 5 actors in this room. I replaced a useless object 98 or Redead and Gibdo object with the Stalfos object or 32. The final Debug versions of the game only loads 1 actor or Dark Link. And I had to change the Bubble's variable from 5FB to FFFF so the area doesn't crash. FFFF is the Blue Bubble. Unsure why the game crashes with the original 5FB though but it could be path related. You can also maybe change it to 0x2B5806E,04FC to make it a small Green Bubble but I never tested it.

(Fanmade) Shooting Gallery CS 01 or Stage 2 actors replaced with Sparkling Rupees. I did this as 5 actors didn't load. I should of maybe kept that 1 actor however that is actor 8C with variable 7 since that actor does load and it makes the skybox have fluffy clouds. But sadly, I didn't.

Ganon's Tower (Outside) Link's spawnpoint fix for CS 00 so his coords are the same as the regular area. This fix fixes it so Link can enter the area from the Market Adult area without being put back as his spawnpoint before this fix was behind the collision trigger for entering the Market Adult area. I don't think you can test this ingame with the map select as the opt option doesn't work unfortunately.

(Fanmade) Cutscene Map Link is present in all areas of the CS Map except Stage 3 or CS 02, Stage 8 or CS 07, and Stage 9 or CS 08. I did this as you can see him in those 2 unless you move him. You can't see him actually in the other stages with him present I think since it doesn't render that far away. Unless you use a cheat code though.

0x2EA1037,03

(Fanmade) Jabu Jabu's Belly (Boss) Lowered the y coord of the door to the ground as Link could not open it to get back inside Jabu Jabu's Belly since the door was a brown door. And not a Jabu Jabu skin door which are usually in the air or positioned differently. This door is behind a collision wall so you can't really open it by normal means

(Fanmade) Shadow Temple (Boss) Collision Changed for the Exit to the Shadow Temple from the boss room as the area will crash if it gets triggered. I could not figure out how to fix that crash so this will do. Unfortunately, if this collision was changed to prevent the crash, you can't get back inside room 2. You will be stuck in room 1 as you can't open the boss door from the other side. So you either have to warp out or save and quit.

(Fanmade) Spirit Temple (Boss) Scene changed from Field to Dungeon for the doors to have the dungeon skin. And variables changed to 3F so they load in Stage 1 or CS 00 and Stage 2 or CS 01. The original or variable 17F doors would not appear. And Rotated Boss door so Link can open it to leave. I believe you don't have to do 0x31AABBF,57 though in CS 02 or Stage 3 as that changes the Boss door's switch flag from 154 to 157. I just changed it to 157 as I wanted to use another switch flag.

Beta Castle Courtyard or Hyrule Garden Game 2. Inaccurate Fix so the scene loads. This 1st fix from Zelootma hack isn't the best as the water texture doesn't load but this is what I did for my fixed scene hack so far. So I'm going to put a better fix for it below. I am unsure what 0x328301F,FF does but I don't believe its necessary to have it.

Correct Fix so the scene loads with the water texture. 1st address is just to make sure its exactly 4BC8. As the Zelootma hack changed that from 4BC8 to 2708.

Royal Family's Tomb CS 00 or Stage 1 and CS 01 or Stage 2's Royal Family Tomb Door object 18F and Bombable wall object 18A loaded by replacing 2 useless objects with it for room 1. The 79 is a coord fix for the bombable wall so its less close to the door. If the coord was not fixed, Link can open the door to go through the bombable wall in room 1 to room 2.

Royal Family's Tomb CS 00 or Stage 1 and CS 01 or Stage 2's Royal Family Tomb Door object 18F and Bombable wall object 18A loaded by replacing 2 useless objects with it for room 3. By the way, you need all the non (Fanmade) Royal Family's Tomb stuff as the transitions that are used in this area are variable 3F so all objects need to be the same for all rooms. The 7F is a Y coord fix so its lower for the Play Ocarina Here Spot 12E actor. This makes it so Link can check the actor as in those unused CS setups in the final, Link could not do that.

(Fanmade) Talon's House Changed the scene setting from 02 to 03 or from Field to Dungeon to make the doors the dungeon ones because the Lon Lon Ranch door was that door skin too. Only use with that one.

(Fanmade) Talon's House Added Young Malon object and actor by shifting the scene in room 3 which is the area Ingo sleeps when you are an Adult. Young Malon only appears here as a child at night after you give the chicken to wake Talon up in Hyrule Castle. She has unused coding to do so. Atm, with these hex address changes, you can only see Young Malon here at night through the Map Select or by cheating since the door can't be opened at night to go into Talon's House.
